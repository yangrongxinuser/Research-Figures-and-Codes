# Research Figures and Codes 📊💻

Welcome to the **Research Figures and Codes** repository! 🎉 This repository serves as a centralized hub for all the visualizations and corresponding codes created during my research journey in the **AI for Healthcare** domain. 

## 🔍 Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following main folders:

- **`figures/`**  
  Contains a collection of figures generated during my research. These visualizations are used to highlight insights and findings in various healthcare-related projects. The figures include, but are not limited to:
  - Machine learning model performance metrics
  - Data analysis results
  - Clinical outcome predictions and more.

- **`codes/`**  
  Houses the corresponding code for each figure in the `figures/` folder. The majority of the scripts are written in **R**, reflecting the heavy usage of R in my previous research. However, you might also find occasional Python or other language scripts when appropriate.

Each subfolder and file is named clearly to indicate the relationship between figures and codes, making it easy to find the script for any specific visualization.

## 🚀 Why This Repository?

This repository aims to:
1. **Centralize resources**: Compile all research visualizations and scripts in one place for easy reference and reuse.
2. **Promote reproducibility**: Share the exact code used to generate figures, enabling others to replicate and build upon the work.
3. **Encourage collaboration**: Provide resources that might help others working in the intersection of AI and healthcare.

## 🌱 Future Updates

This repository is a work in progress and will be updated continuously as my research evolves. Stay tuned for new figures, insights, and cutting-edge techniques! 🚧
